Nowadays,it is important to keep track of the mental health of the people, mainly teenagers. The level of mental health of a person has been found affected with numerous personal as well as professional demands.This project is a mental health assessment web application that aims to evaluate individuals' levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Users navigate through three sections, each containing seven questions related to the respective mental health category. The application calculates scores based on user responses and provides a final assessment of their mental health status. The results categorize users into different levels, such as "No depression," "Mild depression," "High depression," "No anxiety," "Mild anxiety," "High anxiety," "No stress," "Mild stress," or "High stress." The application incorporates HTML for structuring the interface, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and score computation. Considerations for code organization, UI improvements, and error handling contribute to a more user-friendly and robust mental health assessmentÂ tool.
